WAYW - What Are You Watching

This is a server that can synchronise video playback between multiple devices on a trigger point; i.e. you can watch a video on your computer and then transfer the video to your phone to watch it elsewhere.
It can also use a "controller", which changes player attributes like "is paused", the video quality, and the volume level, and apply those changes to the client.
